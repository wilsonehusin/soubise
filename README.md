## Trivia

The project name was inspired by [_Hôtel de Soubise_][wiki-hotel-de-soubise], which has been part of [French National Archives since 1808][wiki-french-national-archives].

[Soubise is also a name for a sauce in French culinary][wiki-soubise-sauce].

This project is **not** affiliated with either.
